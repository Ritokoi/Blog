Today is the birthday of one of my sisters, loud music about youtubers and minecraft, my neighbor with 
even louder trap, an aunt of 70++ years came and the main conversation between she, me and my mother 
ended being about covid vaccine, cryptocurrencys,
how everything is gonna be ending being automatized and 
she asking me to teach her how to use computers... no, i didn't start these topics...
it's weird i know, you normaly expect to talk with your old family members about the past and "normal" things, 
not this xD.
<p>Also they scold me for not keeping up with 🌺 in studies, they think 
im not doing anything to reciprocate her efforts,
their mindset is "college degree is everything", they are right saying i wasted a lot of time
the last year, mainly the first half trying other things but i failed and covid arrived.
But in the second half many things happened...
so i guess i'm going to try platzi to strengthen the knowledge i'm getting right now, i want to improve</p>
