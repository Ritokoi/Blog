Holy shit, i'm playing valorant while writing this and an earthquake just happened,
never experienced one in my life, i mean never noticed one even if happened, this was a powerful one
the electricity poles and houses trembled so rough, people ran outside, if it had been a little more
powerful my house would be collapsed, we live in a fake tranquillity, at any time everything can change,
don't believe me?, covid-19
