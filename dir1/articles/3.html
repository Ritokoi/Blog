In front of my house kekw, although it's a bit clickbait,
on the corner of my street there are some "bandalos" (criminals), guys who sell drugs in the zone, one of the guys came 
while i was buying milk and he simply take the money from my hands, to have claimed him it would have 
ended with him shooting me because the guy was drugged.
Calling the police would have been an option but i let it pass,
with time the police will catch them, a while ago they dismantled the previous ones
