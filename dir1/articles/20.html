Yeah, i solved the puzzle since a few days ago, you know what i mean, but i won't do anything, 
i never wanted to do anything, i just wanted to know the <i>real</i> <b>truth</b>, that's all.
Lies eventually come to light and just cause more suffering.
The truth might have it's reasons to be hidden, but i don't get in there.
Finally i have peace of mind, i have my path clear and from now on i will be working for that, 
i'm used to nobody believing on me, but it's ok, if i fail nothing will change but at least
i will be happy because i tried. Life is full of failures, but it doesn't mean that your over,
idk if something is or not the right decision, both may be the right decision,
but if you are happy doing it, maybe that's the right decision
