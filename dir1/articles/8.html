Finally, finished, i know isn't perfect, the gif sizes are huge but i made them :c,
the code and idea itself are a puzzle, may seem like a useless site but i just wanted to give a message with
the problem of the social networks, technology is there to improve people's lives, not to be the life itself
thats why i'm worried about the future, it may end being a chinese ultra tracked system like 1984
with the corps controlling everything.
It's clear that i was inspired a lot by the fauux site, 
of course his site is waaaaay better than mine,
but i didn't do it to be better than his, i don't want to compare myself to anyone, 
i didn't do it to satisfy anyone, i just wanted to be happy with my own work.
But you wonder how it took you so long with such a small site?
i don't like to use the excuse of being a rookie, but I'm a rookie :^) also i am a 🐌, 
i had nothing planned, i tried so many things and i was not satisfied, i actually canceled making a maze on 
the page days before publishing it, i was not able to do it and
i felt pressured to publish it, why?, were 2 weeks of 10hrs++ of work per day and 1~ week 6 hours per day, 
just tired and wanted to start another project. Having done the maze would have been another week to well understand data structures, 
from now on i want to remove this stake (yes, stake) from my chest that i have for programming, 
which is not to understand data structures.
