They are from the same specie but they act different to mans, sometimes idk what's in their heads,
they are so difficult to understand but for some reason even being dificcult they make us happy, 
sometimes you just have to reject their whims, sometimes you have to obey 
their things, why?, love ^^
<p>
Put 2 ants in a jar, a red one and a black one, they won't do anything, then shake the jar and they will
fight each other thinking that the guilty was the other ant, but the real guilty is the one who
shake the jar.
<ul>
    <li>Mans vs Womans</li>
    <li>Poor vs Rich</li>
    <li>Sciencie vs Churchs</li>
    <li>Capitalism vs Socialism</li>
</ul>
and a lot more...
do not waste energies fighting for that shit, (fighting != talk/debate to improve things), 
do whatever you want but don't fight for those things, because that's what they want
