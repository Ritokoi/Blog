This series came at the right time, we are literally all hikikomoris with this pandemic, 
it made me feel even more miserable but 
also gave me hope, you could say it was a double-edged sword, 
it reinforced both, sad and positive emotions, but it gave me the message i needed right now.
The anime itself is 10/10, 
it seemed original to me, well run, incredible music, characters that fulfill their function well, 
interesting history, the more you feel sad the more you like this show, one of the best anime i've seen, what a luck
i'm having lately with the anime.
